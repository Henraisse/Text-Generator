JERUSALEM รณ Four attacks by Palestinians in Jerusalem and a city 40 miles away killed three Israeli Jews and wounded at least a dozen others in two hours on Tuesday morning, the police said, the most intense eruption so far in two weeks of escalating violence that has alarmed Israel and flummoxed its security forces.

The Israeli authorities said two assailants boarded a public bus in Jerusalem and shot and stabbed riders, killing two men. The third Israeli fatality occurred in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Jerusalem, when a Palestinian worker for the Israeli telephone company rammed the companys car into pedestrians, then got out and attacked them with an ax. There were also two stabbings in Raanana, a city of 80,000 that is home to many American immigrant families.

Police officers killed one of the bus attackers and wounded the other, while a security guard fatally shot the phone company worker.

It started with knives, then cars and now guns, said Aliza Ben Zichri, a retired kindergarten teacher who was one of the many who rushed to the scene of the bus attack after hearing gunfire.

Why not put them under curfew. Ms. Ben Zichri, 59, asked of the citys 300,000 Palestinian residents. I should be able to walk freely.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called an emergency meeting of top security officials and ministers for Tuesday afternoon. A police spokeswoman said the steps to be considered included a complete closing of Jerusalems Arab neighborhoods, whose residents are generally not citizens of Israel but can freely roam the country and often work in Jewish areas, and an easing of gun-licensing procedures.

At the scene of the bus attack, Mayor Nir Barkat of Jerusalem called for new restrictions on Arab neighborhoods in the city.

We have to stop and place a curfew, he said. We must widen and upgrade the steps taken up until now.

Mr. Barkat, who last week urged residents with licensed guns to start carrying them in the streets, added This has to stop, even if residents pay a price in their quality of life. We need to stop this and take control of the reality we live in.

The outbreak of violence on Tuesday came after four stabbing attacks on Monday in Jerusalem, including one in which a 13-year-old Jew riding his bicycle was critically wounded by two Palestinian cousins, 13 and 15. The younger assailant was hit by a car and severely hurt as he tried to flee, the police said, while the older one was fatally shot by officers, prompting outrage.

Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, called the killing of the 15-year-old a heinous crime and compared it to an episode widely seen as having helped incite the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in 2000.

If the Israeli government continues with this escalation of this dangerous method of executions, the region will be in a position that cannot be controlled, and everyone will pay a heavy price, Mr. Rudeineh said in a statement reported by Palestinian news outlets.

Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, sent the Security Council an urgent letter on Monday night listing numerous cases in which Israeli forces fatally shot attackers, as well as people protesting against Israels occupation in the West Bank and rushing toward the fence that separates Israel from the Gaza Strip.

Each day that passes, more innocent lives are lost, as is any hope to reach a peaceful two-state solution in the future, the letter says. The violations mentioned above should trigger immediate action by the international community, including the Security Council, to finally take measures to provide the Palestinian civilian population with immediate protection.

There have been more than 20 attacks, mostly stabbings, already this month, killing a total of seven Israeli Jews. At least 11 of those suspected of being assailants have been shot dead by Israeli security forces or, in one case, a victim who pulled out a pistol. Most of the attacks have been in Jerusalem, but violence has also struck in Kiryat Arba, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. in the cultural and financial capital, Tel Aviv. and in far-flung, normally peaceful towns.

A 15-month inquiry into the disintegration of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in the skies over eastern Ukraine has concluded that the aircraft was most likely attacked from the ground by a Russian-made missile, Dutch air accident investigators said on Tuesday.

The findings รณ based on distinctive metal shrapnel and traces of paint in the bodies of crew members in the cockpit, near where the missile hit รณ are the most detailed evidence so far from a five-nation investigative team that has retrieved and sifted through several tons of debris and human remains.

While the findings stop short of assigning responsibility for the crash, a task that has been left to Dutch prosecutors, they appear consistent with a theory widely promoted by the authorities in the United States and Ukraine that the plane, a Boeing 777, was shot down by Russian-backed separatists armed with an SA-11, or Buk, surface-to-air missile.

Russia has vehemently disputed that theory, and it continued to do so on Tuesday with a competing presentation, saying that the missile must have been fired from Ukrainian-held territory, and that it was of a type that is no longer found in Russias arsenal.

The report on the July 17, 2014, crash, which killed all 298 people aboard, is being presented at a news conference at 115 pm at the Gilze-Rijen Air Base in the Netherlands by Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board. The flights passengers and crew members came from about a dozen countries, but two-thirds of those on board were Dutch citizens.

The board was sharply critical of the Ukrainian authorities for failing to close the airspace above the conflict zone. It found that 160 civil aviation flights went through on the day of the crash, until the airspace was closed.

Why was Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 flying over an area where an armed conflict was taking place. Mr. Joustra asked, using a common reference to the flight number. The question was on the minds of many people after the crash. The answer was as straightforward as it is disquieting almost all operators were flying over that area. And why. Because nobody thought that civil aviation was at risk.

There was sufficient reason to close the airspace as a precaution, but the Ukrainian authorities failed to do so, he said.

The team of investigators was led by the Netherlands but included members from four other countries heavily affected by the crash Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. In addition to what brought down the aircraft, the safety board has examined why the plane was flying over a region in conflict. whether the passengers would have been conscious as the plane went down. and why some relatives had to wait as long as 14 days before getting confirmation that their loved ones were on board.

In addition to studying the causes of the crash, the Dutch report will also identify a number of shortcomings in the systems that governments have in place for communicating risks to commercial airliners when flying over conflict zones.

From the outset, the Russian government has tried to offer alternative versions of what caused the plane to break up over eastern Ukraine.

Initially, the Defense Ministry presented what generals said was radar data indicating that a Ukrainian fighter jet had flown nearby, possibly shooting down the Malaysia Airlines flight. This year, officials with Almaz-Antey, the state corporation that manufactures the Buk antiaircraft missiles, held a news conference in Moscow to say that they believed one of their missiles had shot down the plane, but that an analysis of the angle of impact showed it must have been fired from territory controlled by the Ukrainian Army.

To coincide with the Dutch announcement, Almaz-Antey scheduled a news conference on Tuesday to reveal the results of what the company said was its own investigation, which it added was an expensive experiment in which a Buk warhead was detonated near the fuselage of a passenger jet.

Then, this month, after a Ukrainian security official had suggested in an interview with the Dutch news media that shrapnel removed from the bodies of the victims proved a Buk was to blame, Tass, the Russian state news agency, quoted an independent expert objecting that it was too early to conclude such a missile brought down the plane.

Tass quoted the expert, Ivan Konovalov, the director of a Moscow research center, the Center for Strategic Trends, as saying that if the Dutch Safety Board indeed reaches a firm conclusion that the Boeing was struck by a Buk antiaircraft rocket, then it should be taken into consideration that at that time only the armed services of Ukraine had these complexes and the Peoples Republics of Donbas had no such complex systems then or now. He was referring to pro-Russian separatist governments set up in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

The Kremlin has denied any involvement in arming separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine or the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines flight.
